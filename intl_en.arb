  "about_neer": "Project NEER was conceived by Department of Computer Science, Gujarat University under intellectual guidance from Space Application Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The project is sponsored by Department of Science and Technology (DST), India for the year 2021-2024. The main objective of the project is to exploit the power of Citizen Science tools in monitoring water bodies and managing water resources division support system.",
  "parameters_used": "Turbidity, FUI index, chlorophyll, temperature, pH, DO, Conductivity, Secchi depth.",
  "what_app_does": "This NEER Application will provide the important information about the water quality parameters of inland water bodies. A registered volunteer now a citizen scientist captures photo of water body and measures chemical properties through instrument. The measured data is sent to a remote server tagged with location of volunteer, date and time of observation. The collected data repository on a hosted server is available for further analysis.",
  "who_are_we": "We are a collaborative workgroup of scientists (SAC), professors (Gujarat University), research scholars and citizen scientists working collectively on the major water issues.",
  "how_to_proceed": "Click the “Let’s get started” button to move on to the user information page. Continue to set the location, Select the water body and enter the information manually. Images of water, Gray card and sky are taken for Turbidity, chlorophyll and FUI index estimation. Be sure to touch the save button on the bottom of each page. Individual page instructs how to proceed to the next. The final tab helps to submit the user data.",
